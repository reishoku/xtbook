WHAT IS TCW?
  tcw is a widget toolkit that runs usually with SDL. Originally it was made to 
  use with GCounter, which is the program I was making for the science club I 
  had been belonged to. 

INVOCATION SYSTEM
  tcw supports invocation system. It abstructs a function call and make it
  simpler and safer to call a function in the background, or delayed.
  An abstructed function call is called the invocation.

APP CLASS
  twApp is the core of tcw. It is initialized by calling twInit.

BASE CLASSES
  twEvent
    This manages any events received. It also supports the invocation system.
  twDC
    This abstracts the drawing operations.
  twWnd
    This is much like CWnd in MFC. One of instances can be the "desktop", which
	is the root of the others.
  twFont
    twFont renders text. 
  twBaseSkin
    twBaseSkin renders the border of twWnd, twButton, and so on. It also decides
	colors to render them.
  twTimer
    Needless to say, it is a timer.
  twException
  twInvocation
    This is the core of tcw's invocation system. It abstracts a function call,
	and it must be deleted after it was used. The caller gives the ownership
	completely and mustn't delete it.

BASIC WINDOWS
  twTopWnd
    twTopWnd is a window that can be resized and moved by the user.
	Note that its background is opaque.
  twDialog
    twDialog is a window that cannot be resized, but can be moved by the user.
	One twWnd can be associated with it, as a "modal parent." 

COMMON CONTROLS
  twButton
    twButton is a push button. The user can click it to tell the application 
	something.
  twCheckBox
    twCheckBox is a check box. The user can switch it, and it keeps its state.
  twRadioBtn
    twRadioBtn is just like a check box, but only one can be selected at once.
  twLabel
    twLabel just displays text. No other action.

COMMON DIALOG
  twMsgBox
    twMsgBox is much like MessageBox of Win32, except that it doesn't support
	icons such as MB_ICONINFORMATION.

SDL SPECIFIC
  twSDLDC
    twSDLDC converts some drawing operations to SDL's ones. It also supports
	loading XPM, BMP, and so on.
  twSDLEvent
    twSDLEvent communicates with SDL's event system and manages some events.
	Invocation system is implemented as well.
	
OTHER CLASSES
  twVGAFont
	twVGAFont is the built-in font. It supports only OEM/DOS charset.
  twExposureFont
    twExposureFont supports fonts of Exposure, which is the program
	I had been making for several weeks.
  twTimerWithInvocation
	This is the timer that uses twInvocation. It is useful, but make sure to 
	invalidate it before deleting the target class.
